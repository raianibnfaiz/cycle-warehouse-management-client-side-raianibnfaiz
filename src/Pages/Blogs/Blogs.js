                    <p className=' mt-5'><span className="text-primary">Answer:</span> JavaScript is a high-level programming language that makes our web pages and web applications dynamic and interactive by giving them the ability to think and act. JavaScript is a lightweight and object-oriented programming language whereas Node.js is a runtime environment built on google v8 engine and typically used to represent a list of objects and functions that JavaScript programs can access.
                        JavaScript is a proper high-level programming language used to create web scripts whereas Node.js is a run time environment built on google v8 engine. JavaScript is executed in the browser whereas using Node.js gives us the ability to execute JavaScript outside the browser. </p>

                    <p className='text-justify mt-5'><span className="text-primary">Answer:</span> JSON Web Token-JWT, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued. JWT differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been granted. </p>
